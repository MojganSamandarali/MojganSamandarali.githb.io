# Overview

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of grassroots innovations (GIs) across Iran, contributing valuable insights to the study of bottom-up innovation in developing countries. The research explores how community-driven, locally sourced innovations contribute to sustainable development by addressing local needs with low-cost, accessible solutions. The project culminated in a published paper, enhancing the academic discourse on grassroots innovation as a vital, alternative approach to traditional, top-down innovation models.

# Key Findings

Using a dataset collected from multiple provinces in Iran, I analyzed the demographics, geographic distribution, and professional backgrounds of grassroots innovators. This research provided a unique perspective on grassroots innovation in Iran, revealing the following:

Geographic and Demographic Insights: Unlike typical patent-driven innovations concentrated in major cities, Iran’s grassroots innovations are spread across diverse regions, especially in Fars and South Khorasan provinces. A significant finding was the high level of education among Iranian grassroots innovators, with 67% holding higher education qualifications, which is unique compared to innovators in similar countries.

Three Distinct Innovator Clusters: Through clustering and correspondence analysis, I identified three main groups of grassroots innovators:

Cluster 1: Highly educated, young male innovators (ages 21–40) working in fields like physics and electricity.
Cluster 2: Older males (ages 40+) with mid-level education in rural areas focusing on engineering and transportation.
Cluster 3: Young female students (ages 10–20) primarily innovating in chemistry and addressing human necessities.
These clusters emphasize how education, age, and region influence the types of innovations generated, highlighting the diversity and regional specificity of grassroots innovation in Iran.

Innovation Fields: The majority of innovations fell under “Human Necessities,” including agriculture and public health, followed by mechanical engineering and electrical solutions, reflecting the practical, community-oriented nature of grassroots innovations.
Methods
The research used Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and K-means clustering to uncover hidden patterns among innovators. By analyzing innovation submissions through these methods, I was able to delineate distinct demographic and occupational profiles, providing insights that are critical for tailored policy support.

Impact and Implications
This study underscores the role of grassroots innovation in Iran’s development landscape, showing that bottom-up, community-driven solutions are pivotal for sustainable progress. The findings suggest that GIs can be a valuable addition to Iran’s innovation policy, complementing traditional R&D-driven approaches by leveraging local knowledge and resources.
